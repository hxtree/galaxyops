This
[design system](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/)
contains common components for use in other front end applications. It contains
a Storybook service that is deployed to empower designers. It also builds and
publishes a package of those designs for use in other applications.

**Features**:

- **UI Component Development**: Allows for the local development of UI
  components in isolation.
- **UI Component Library**: This is library containing UI components that
  front-ends can use to ensure consistently in design.
- **UI Design System**: Deploys a static design system website.

## Components

This package should only contain pure and presentational components. This is not
superset of every component library in an organization. That would be a headache
to keep track of. These are **reusable** components.

The following properties are essential in allowing the component to be reusable:

- Components MUST deal with how UI appears.
- Components MUST respond exclusively to `props`.
- Components SHOULD NOT contain app-specific business logic.
- Components MUST be agnostic to how data loads.

## Guidelines

- Use Component Story Format [CSF](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf)
- Per Palmer Group guidelines,
  [always use named exports.](https://github.com/palmerhq/typescript#exports).
  Code split inside your React app instead of your React library.
