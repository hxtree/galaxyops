          They outline a character's abilities, potential, and constraints. Each
          character sheet draws inspiration from a designated archetype, shaping
          their possibilities and outlining the skills they can or cannot
          acquire. While an archetype does not detail everything, it plays a
          vital role in guiding both player and non-player character creation.
