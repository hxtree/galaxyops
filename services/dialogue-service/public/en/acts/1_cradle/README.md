# Act 1: Cradle

## Preface

Metaphorically, a cradle often symbolizes a place of beginning, nurturing, or
potential. It represents the start of life, growth, or a new idea, providing a
supportive and protective environment where something delicate can develop and
flourish.

## Plot

1. Meeku and his brother Vallon reside on a secluded farm with their mother in a
   remote village. They work tirelessly to maintain the farm, while also
   training to become skilled fighters like their late father.
2. One fateful night, Vallon leaves to join the army, leaving Meeku and their
   mother alone on the farm. Meeku vows to protect his mother and continue the
   farm work until Vallon's return. However, their mother falls ill from a
   broken heart and passes away during winter.
3. Despite his grief and loneliness, Meeku stays true to his promise and
   continues to farm the land and train by himself. Four and a half years later,
   he returns from his training in the forest only to find his home in flames.
4. Meeku confronts a group of soldiers who surrounded him, demanding to know his
   brother's whereabouts. They engage in a battle, and Meeku emerges victorious.
   But in the fight, he encounters a mysterious beast that he had only heard
   about in his mother's stories.
5. With nothing left to protect and nowhere to call home, Meeku sets out on a
   journey to find his brother. He traverses through unfamiliar terrains,
   including a scorching desert, where the heat takes a toll on him and causes
   him to lose his memory.

## Notes

- Vallon has earned the moniker "Destroyer of Hearts," as his actions have
  caused great anguish and shattered his own mother's heart.
- Vachel, once a small and frail bull, eventually grows into a mighty and
  formidable creature, becoming an invaluable summon later on in the game.
