# Act 4: Manger

## Preface

Metaphorically, a manger represents humility, sustenance, and the birth of new
beginnings. It symbolizes a place of modesty and simplicity where something
precious is nurtured and welcomed into the world. Often associated with the
nativity scene, it conveys the idea of profound significance emerging from
humble origins and the nurturing of hope or potential in an unadorned setting.
