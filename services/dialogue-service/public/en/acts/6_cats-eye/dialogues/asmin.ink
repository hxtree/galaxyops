Gunter spoke highly of you, Asmin. # actorId: MEEKU_ONI

grins, chuckles. # actorId: ASMIN

He said your strength and resolve were unmatched. # actorId: MEEKU_ONI

Strength is born from overcoming challenges; I’ve faced many and risen above them all. # actorId: ASMIN

But what led you to this path? How did you end up here? # actorId: MEEKU_ONI

A story... Alright. Here is the tale of how I gained my freedom. During my childhood, I engaged in self-deception, setting myself impossible challenges. A part of me always urged me on, insisting I had to accomplish these tasks or face dire consequences. It started small—never miss... ten, twenty, hundreds, thousands. Over time, those thoughts grew louder, taking on a voice of their own. # actorId: ASMIN

A voice... and what does this voice say about Vallon? What happened to my brother? # actorId: MEEKU_ONI

I know Vallon uses me as a pawn, but I’m a willing participant in this game. As he maneuvers, my skills are sharpened, and my life gains purpose, and the voice is quelled. Every step I take is a tactical move in this grand strategy. Yes, he decides when I’m sacrificed, but until that moment, I’ll play my role and relish the combat. My pride is my strength, and I stand tall in his shadow. # actorId: ASMIN

I don't understand. # actorId: MEEKU_ONI

Enough of this chatter, boy. Let’s see if you can evade the cleave of my axe. # actorId: ASMIN

As the clash begins, Meeku quickly finds himself outmatched. Suddenly, a large cloaked figure steps in, interrupting the fight. The right side of his face is shown, to be metal like a robot. The identity remains unknown.
