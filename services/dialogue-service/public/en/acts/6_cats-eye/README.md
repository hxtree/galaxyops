# Act 6: Cats Eye

## Preface

Metaphorically, a cat's eye symbolizes insight, mystery, and perceptiveness. It
represents a keen, watchful awareness and the ability to see beyond the surface,
often hinting at hidden truths or deeper understanding. The eyeâ€™s reflective
quality can also suggest intuition and the ability to navigate through life's
complexities with a sense of grace and agility.
