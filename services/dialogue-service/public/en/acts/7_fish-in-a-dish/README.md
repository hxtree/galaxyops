# Act 7: Fish In A Dish

## Preface

Metaphorically, a fish in a dish represents confinement, vulnerability, or being
out of one’s natural element. It can symbolize a sense of being trapped or
restricted within a particular situation, contrasting with the freedom and
natural habitat that the fish would otherwise enjoy. Additionally, it can
reflect the fragility and impermanence of existence when one is removed from
their usual context.

## Plot
