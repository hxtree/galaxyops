# Act 8: Clock

## Preface

Metaphorically, a clock symbolizes the passage of time, the inevitability of
change, and the urgency of lifeâ€™s fleeting moments. It represents the relentless
forward march of time, the structure it imposes on our lives, and the tension
between the desire to control or cherish time and its constant, indifferent
progression. The clock can also signify the cyclical nature of life, deadlines,
and the balance between past, present, and future.
