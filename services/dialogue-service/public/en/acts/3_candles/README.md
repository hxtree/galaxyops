# Act 3: Candles

## Preface

Metaphorically, candles often symbolize illumination, hope, and the fragility of
life. They represent the light of knowledge, inspiration, or spirituality that
can dispel darkness. Additionally, a candleâ€™s flame signifies the ephemeral
nature of existence, reminding us of the fleeting but beautiful moments that
shine briefly before fading away.

   inn at a town they find. Meeku sits and looks out the window thinking for
