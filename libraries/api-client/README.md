Service Endpoint Contracts are a part of the Microservice API Patterns (MAP).
Contracts are used for to define communication agreements between microservices.
Contracts exist as `openapi-specs.json` files. A API Client is generated from
each contract.

## Updating

**WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY AUTOGENERATED API CLIENTS**

All contracts are owned by the service that is depended on. Each service offers
a contract in the form of an `openapi-spec.json` file. All contracts are
automatically generated from the services that is depended on. From those
contracts a API client is automatically generated for use in other applications.

1. Bring up the service with openapi endpoint to automatically build a new
   openapi-spec.json file

2. Next build an API client using the newly generate contract.

```bash
rush api
```

## Guidelines

Each API version, e.g. `/auth-service/v1/`

Each services contracts should adhere to the following:

```
Queries
* API/Rest/POJO
  query / find, findBy, findAll, get. has
e.g. get-user.query.ts


Commands
* Raises event SNS -> SQS
* A command can fire off another command but should not call itself from within service

  subscribe
  create
  update
  delete

e.g. create-user.command.ts
```
